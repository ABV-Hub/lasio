LAS Reader
==========

``las_reader`` is a Python package to read in Log ASCII Standard (LAS) files, used in geophysical 
logging. The file format is specified by the 
[Canadian Well Logging Society](http://www.cwls.org/las/). The intention is to get the data out for use with ``numpy`` and other scientific Python tools.

There's an example IPython Notebook on how to use it here:

Feel free to submit pull requests or issues, or even just examples of LAS files that it won't read.

The code is freely available for any kind of use or modification under the MIT License.
