Contributing to ``lasio``
=========================

Any help is very welcome! This project is only maintained as a
side-project by `@kinverarity1 <https://github.com/kinverarity1>`__ and it may 
take me some time to get around
to responding to emails, issues, or PRs, but please know they are all
very welcome :-)

It should go without saying, but please also take a look at the `code of conduct <https://github.com/kinverarity1/lasio/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`__.

Issues
------

|GitHub Issues|

Please don’t hesitate to open a `GitHub issue`_ for any problems you are
having with lasio, or any ideas for improvements. The large backlog of
issues is partly due to time pressure but also a recognition of the fact
improvements are always possible.

Pull requests
-------------

|GitHub pull requests|

I will be very happy to review or incorporate changes or additions to
code in any form. The easiest method is to fork lasio on GitHub and
submit a pull request against ``master``. Don’t worry about getting all
the details right, either way it’s still the most convenient way for me
or other maintainers to see your changes in context.

Example LAS files
-----------------

If you have an interesting/difficult/silly/standards-challenged/WTF LAS
file (any version) you would be willing to share with me, please do so!
Email it to me at `kinverarity@hotmail.com <kinverarity@hotmail.com>`__. 
The more examples I can
incorporate into lasio’s unit testing, the better. If you have concerns
about privacy, I’d suggest obfuscating with find-and-replace on various
alpha (or numeric) characters before sending it on, or deleting any
sensitive header lines.

Email
-----

Please feel free to email me at `kinverarity@hotmail.com <kinverarity@hotmail.com>`__ with any
suggestions, criticisms, questions, example files.

Thanks
