``lasio`` - Log ASCII Standard (LAS) files in Python
====================================================

`Project home page with tutorials <https://github.com/kinverarity1/lasio>`__

.. |image0| |image1| |Research software impact|

.. This is a Python 2/3 package to read and write Log ASCII Standard (LAS)
.. files, used for borehole data such as geophysical, geological, or
.. petrophysical logs. It's compatible with versions 1.2 and 2.0 of the LAS
.. file specification, published by the `Canadian Well Logging
.. Society <http://www.cwls.org/las>`__. In principle it is designed to
.. read as many types of LAS files as possible, including ones containing
.. common errors or non-compliant formatting.

.. Depending on your particular application you may also want to check out
.. `striplog <https://github.com/agile-geoscience/striplog>`__ for
.. stratigraphic/lithological data, or (still in alpha dev)
.. `welly <https://github.com/agile-geoscience/welly>`__ for dealing with
.. data at the well level. lasio is primarily for reading & writing LAS
.. files.

.. Note this is *not* a package for reading LiDAR data (also called "LAS
.. files").
