LAS Reader
==========

``las_reader`` is a Python package to read in Log ASCII Standard (LAS) files, used in geophysical 
logging. The file format is specified by the 
[Canadian Well Logging Society](http://cwls.org/las_info.php). The intention is to get the data in a useful and easy format for ``numpy``.

There's an example IPython Notebook on how to use it here:
