# Contributing

Any help is very welcome! This project is only maintained as a side-project by @kinverarity1 and it may take me some time to get around to responding to emails, issues, or PRs, but please know they are all very welcome :-)

## Issues

[![GitHub Issues](http://githubbadges.herokuapp.com/kinverarity1/lasio/issues.svg)](https://github.com/kinverarity1/lasio/issues)

Please don't hesitate to open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/kinverarity1/lasio/issues/new) for any problems you are having with lasio, or any ideas for improvements. The large backlog of issues is partly due to time pressure but also a recognition of the fact improvements are always possible.

## Pull requests

[![GitHub pull requests](http://githubbadges.herokuapp.com/kinverarity1/lasio/pulls.svg)](https://github.com/kinverarity1/lasio/pulls)

I will be very happy to review or incorporate changes or additions to code in any form. The easiest method is to fork lasio on GitHub and submit a pull request against ``master``. Don't worry about getting all the details right, either way it's still the most convenient way for me or other maintainers to see your changes in context. 

## Example LAS files

If you have an interesting/difficult/silly/standards-challenged/WTF LAS file (any version) you would be willing to share with me, please do so!! Email it to me at kinverarity@hotmail.com. The more examples I can incorporate into lasio's unit testing, the better. If you have concerns about privacy, I'd suggest obfuscating with find-and-replace on various alpha (or numeric) characters before sending it on, or deleting any sensitive header lines.

## Email

Please feel free to email me at kinverarity@hotmail.com  with any suggestions, criticisms, questions, example files. 

## Thanks

Thank you to all those who have helped, whether by email or via GitHub. My apologies to anyone I have missed.
